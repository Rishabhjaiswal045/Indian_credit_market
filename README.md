üí≥ Card Category Insights: Breakdown of performance by card type (Gold, Platinum, Visa, etc.) and co-branding partnerships.

üìà Dashboard Preview
(Note: You would replace the description below with an actual screenshot of your dashboard. Since I can't see it, I've described a common layout.)

The dashboard is organized into several key visual sections:

Top Banner: Key Metrics (Total Applications, Monthly Growth, Approved Apps, Approval Rate) displayed as dynamic cards.

Central Map: A geographic map of India color-coded by approval rate or application volume.

Trend Charts: Line charts showing application and approval trends over time (June-August).

Breakdown Charts: Bar and pie charts for Sector Performance, Card Type Distribution, and Bank-wise analysis.

Interactive Slicers: Filters on the side for user-driven exploration.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation
Data Integration
Data was consolidated from multiple sources (#ChatGPT, #Claude, #DeepSeek, #Kaggle) into a unified model in Power BI.

Key DAX Formulas
1. Monthly Growth Calculation:

dax
Monthly_Growth =
VAR ThisMonth = [Total_Applications]
VAR LastMonth =
    CALCULATE(
        [Total_Applications],
        DATEADD(Dump[Login_Date], -1, MONTH)
    )
VAR Growth = DIVIDE(ThisMonth - LastMonth, LastMonth)
RETURN
    IF(ISERROR(Growth), 0, Growth)
2. Approval Rate Calculation:

dax
Approval_Rate =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(Dump),
        FILTER(Dump, Dump[Application_Status] = "Approved")
    ),
    [Total_Applications],
    0
)
3. Approved Applications Measure:

dax
Approved_App =
CALCULATE(
    COUNTROWS(Dump),
    FILTER(Dump, Dump[Application_Status] = "Approved")
)
üéØ Insights & Learnings
Market Dominance: The Private Banking sector leads in application volume, indicating aggressive marketing or wider reach.

Geographic Disparity: Approval rates vary significantly by city, suggesting regional differences in creditworthiness or bank policies.

Seasonal Trends: The high rejection rate in July could indicate a shift in lending criteria or an influx of lower-quality applications.

Balanced Portfolio: The equal distribution of card type applications suggests a well-balanced market offering without a single dominant type.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Integrating real-time data feeds for live dashboard updates.

Predictive analytics to forecast application trends and approval likelihood.

Deeper customer segmentation analysis (e.g., by income, age, credit score).
